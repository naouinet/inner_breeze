# Inner Breeze
Guided breathing meditation app based on the Wim Hof breathing method.

## Getting Started
To quickly run the project locally you can use the ```nix develop``` command to create a nix shell with all the dependencies fetched and ready to ```flutter run -d linux```.

For other devices you can first run ```flutter devices``` to see what is available and then target the device of your choice.

Currently the nix development environment is configured to successfully run on linux, chrome and android.
